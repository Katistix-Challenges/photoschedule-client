## Challenge Prompt

**Problem:** Sarah is a freelance photographer who struggles to keep track of her client appointments and manage her photo shoots efficiently. She often finds herself double-booked or forgetting important details about her clients and their preferences.

**Challenge:** Build a web application that helps freelance photographers like Sarah manage their client appointments and photo shoots effectively. However, there's a catch â€“ you can only use asynchronous communication methods for scheduling appointments. This means that the app cannot rely on real-time updates or notifications, and all communication between Sarah and her clients must occur via email or SMS.

This limitation forces you to design a system that can handle scheduling and communication asynchronously, without relying on immediate feedback or real-time updates. You'll need to think about how to manage appointments, send reminders to both Sarah and her clients, and handle any conflicts or changes to the schedule without the need for real-time communication.
